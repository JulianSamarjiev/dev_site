        <p>Letâ€™s assume our shop offers winter sports equipment, namely snowboards, bindings, boots and so on.  The snowboards in this example do not have bindings assembled by default so the customer needs to attach some bindings first before he or she can get out to the slope. Therefore it makes sense to offer the customers some product bundles containing a plain snowboard and a pair of bindings.</p>

        <p>In this tutorial we are going to explain how you can model such product bundles with the data models provided by the SPHERE.IO platform. A general introduction into the data models is given in the Knowledge base article {-->Glossary - Data Models}</p><p>To be able to follow the steps explained in this tutorial you need to have valid credentials for accessing SPHERE.IO projects. If you need assistance with that please have a look at {-->Getting started with SPHERE.IO}</p><p>It is further assumed that there has been defined a ProductType for snowboard bundles beforehand in your project. If you want to know more about ProductType creation for product bundles please get familiar with that topic in tutorial {-->How to create bundle product types}.</p>
